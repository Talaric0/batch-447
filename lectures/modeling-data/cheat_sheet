# First difference
1 ) All models will have an instance variable for id,
    which will be how we identify them.

    PS: usually it will be an attr_accessor

2 ) When saving an "associated" object to the CSV file,
    we save the object_id (because we can't save the whole
    object with all it's attributes to the CSV file)

  ex: on artists.csv, we have the column band_id

3 ) When loading the information from the CSV file,
    you have to find the associated object through it's id,
    because the objects should connect to each other, not to
    each other's ids

  ex: I don't want artist.band_id to work
      I want artist.band to work, so that I can do
             artist.band.genre

  PS: for that, you need the other repo in the initialize!

4 ) When adding a new "artist" to the "@artists", we need
    to give that artist a new ID, which should be the last ID
    we have + 1
